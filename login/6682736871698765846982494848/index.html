    <h2>MESSAGE TO THE SUPREME ONES</h2>
    <p>
      Gracious gods! We call to you now, here, from our mortal realm Earth! We plead to you,
      free us from our worldly bonds! Offer us ascension to witness your vision! Offer us
      the gift of Creation! Offer us to remake our own existence! To remake our own meaning
      of space! Redefine time! Join you among the stars. We make a humble plea to your
      benevolent nature to grant us this ascension, to permit us to carry your Voice!
      <br/><br/>
      We thank you, the all-knowing.
    </p>
