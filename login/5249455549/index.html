      <h2>Your Position</h2>
      <p>The initiate is a lowest form, yet to prove themselves worthy. They are eager to know this Vision, 
        to hear these Voices. We know that they covet this same knowledge, this same power of Creation, 
        but we do not yet permit them to know the methods of our rituals or the Summoning. 
        They must attend the gatherings and practice their loyalty. Only the worthy have the true desire 
        to know our gods’ Vision. Only they will seek the Sun.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "#info2" class = "info2">
      <h2>Your Task Within Our Ranks</h2>
      <p>We allow the initiate to merely watch and observe our form.  
        We request they watch the stars, watch when they flicker violently.
        The initiate must see beyond these glinting lights and listen.
        They will soon see a glimpse of it, the Vision, should they be worthy to hear 
        the Voices.
