      <h2>A Message To All Veterans</h2>
      <p>We have struggled and toiled in the name of the coming day, my most faithful follows. Our work
      will not go unrewarded. Our ambitions will not go unfulfilled. Soon, we will have the very fabric of
      the cosmos at our fingertips. The truth is a powerful thing. But you, my acolytes… I entrust it
      with you.<br></br>
      It is not long until all of our pieces are in place. We will broadcast our plea to the edges of the
      universe. And it shall be answered. Our most righteous Gods, harbingers of enlightenment, shall
      descend upon us. And the most loyal of the flock will receive their blessings first and foremost.<br></br>
      Worry not, my friends. Apotheosis awaits.<br></br>

    <h1>Coronal Ejection: Ousting the Sun-Speaker</h1>
    <p>
      As the Sun-Speaker, it is my duty to relay every single word of the scripture spoken to me by the cosmos. I return to the Sacred Woods (although some simpletons call it the Cursed Woods… how short-sighted of them) every so often to hear the faintest whispers of truth. And over the past few days, a new ritual has been passed down to me… Coronal Ejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is a powerful thing, my children. Precious. Perfect. It cannot be mishandled, misused, in any way. From truth comes enlightenment, and enlightenment, creation… And to bastardize creation is the most profane act of them all. Thus, a ritual has been devised. Should the flock find that the Speaker of the Sun is misusing the truth, they may band together to perform a Coronal Ejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      By raising their hands in the air, clasping the fingers - and for a brief second, letting the threads of this world pass through their grasp - a collective may amass enough enlightenment to strip the Speaker of the Sun of his position, and to snuff out his influence within the Sun-Seekers for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I say this, know that it is my dearest wish to guide all of you through the empyrean gates, to help shine down the light upon each and every one of us. But to inhibit that light in any way is tantamount to heresy. And so, as Speaker of the Sun, I relay this message. It is vital that this ritual remain among only the finest acolytes of the Sun-Seekers. Should the unenlightened, the cosmically blind learn this ritual, they could wreak havoc on this order for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not let the road to ascension dissolve beneath your feet. Follow my footsteps, and together, we shall learn the ways of our Gods.
