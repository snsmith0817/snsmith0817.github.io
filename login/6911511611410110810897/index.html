      <h2>A Message To All Veterans</h2>
      <p>We have struggled and toiled in the name of the coming day, my most faithful follows. Our work
      will not go unrewarded. Our ambitions will not go unfulfilled. Soon, we will have the very fabric of
      the cosmos at our fingertips. The truth is a powerful thing. But you, my acolytes… I entrust it
      with you.<br></br>
      It is not long until all of our pieces are in place. We will broadcast our plea to the edges of the
      universe. And it shall be answered. Our most righteous Gods, harbingers of enlightenment, shall
      descend upon us. And the most loyal of the flock will receive their blessings first and foremost.<br></br>
      Worry not, my friends. Apotheosis awaits.<br></br>
