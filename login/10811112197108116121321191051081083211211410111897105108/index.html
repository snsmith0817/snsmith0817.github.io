	The moment we have all waited for draws near. I turn my face towards the sky and I see the
	most radiant light surrounding us - the cosmos converge, the celestial bodies align, the very
	fabric of our world trembles at the arrival of our God. And yet… Only we seem to recognize it.
	The others go about their daily lives, their dreadfully banal existences, eyes towards the dirt. Do
	they not realize what is approaching? Do they not know what greatness we are about to
	summon into this world? It’s hard for me to comprehend, but… Well, it doesn’t matter. They’ll
	understand when the time comes.
	<br />
	There’s another type of person that baffles me even more. The ignorant have yet to see the
	light, yes, but that can be changed. But those who reject the radiance of our Lord… Those who
	have stood in his glow, but turned the other cheek… How? How could anyone who has looked
	upon our Lord possibly return to their old ways? Why would they ever attempt to undo the
	Sun-Seekers?! We offer the world its apotheosis, and they shun us - SHE shunned us. Why
	couldn’t you just see things my way, Estrella?! Why couldn’t you see the light like I do?!
	Oh, Estrella, Estrella, Estrella… How pitiful your earthly name was. How close you were to
	ascending above this - all of this - if you would just let me guide you. You would have burned so
	bright. I had to extinguish all that you were, Estrella. I had to. You know I did. Sometimes, it
	feels like you’re still watching me… And if you are? I just want to say… You know I was right.
	You regret it. You regret passing up your chance.
	<br />
	But do not worry, Estrella. When the time comes...
	The rest of the world will not make the same mistake.

      <h2>Apprentice Information</h2>
      <p>
	The apprentice has demonstrated themselves as worthy. They have shown that they have that desire for knowledge, 
	to know the Vision. They may have witnessed it already. Soon, they may hear the Voices. We permit them to begin 
	practicing their own rituals so that they may partake in the Summoning. We will offer them more into our secrets 
	of enlightenment. We have faith that the apprentice remains true to our gods’ benevolence and that they will expose 
	the dissenters within our ranks.  We allow the apprentice to participate in our activities to please our gods before
	their arrival.
	<br />
	<br />
	We expect them to aid in these activities as preparation for the Summoning.
	They will learn the fundamental symbols and gestures for our rituals.
	We expect them to recreate these signs in our practices.
	They must maintain their loyalty by searching again for the stars and following them to the Vision.
	<br />
	We all must gaze up, remember to gaze passed the stars, search again for the Voices, and call for their Vision.
